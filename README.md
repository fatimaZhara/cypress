# UI Testing Playground - Cypress Automation Suite

This repository contains an automated end-to-end (E2E) testing suite built with **Cypress** for the [UI Test Automation Playground](http://uitestingplayground.com/) website.  
The project demonstrates automated UI testing techniques while addressing various real-world automation challenges such as dynamic IDs, hidden elements, AJAX delays, and progress tracking.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to automate **12 distinct pages** from the UI Testing Playground using Cypress — each with **positive** and **negative** (or edge case) scenarios.  
All tests include appropriate `cy.wait()` delays to ensure synchronization with animations, AJAX requests, and DOM updates.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Cypress** – End-to-end testing framework for web automation.  
- **Node.js & npm** – Used for dependency management and project setup.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup
